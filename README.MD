# Advanced React Native - Stephen Grider

- we will use Expo for running react native apps

## Options for running React Native

- Expo / Expo Go (App) - running react native apps on real device (device APIs, push notifications, device testing, extra components)
- React Native CLI (basic components / device apis / difficult setup for simulators)

## Expo Dev Tools

EXPO XDE has been replaced by Expo Dev Tools

Expo CLI replaces our previous tools exp (a CLI) and XDE (a desktop app), by providing both an improved version of the familiar command-line interface and a graphical interface running in the browser. It also powers the latest version of Create React Native App.

## install expo

```cmd
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## create a project

NOTE: expo cli recommends using below instead of 'expo init'

```cmd
npx create-expo-app --template
```
